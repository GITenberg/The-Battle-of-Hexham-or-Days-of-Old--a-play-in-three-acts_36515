<h2>
    REMARKS.
</h2>
<p>
Mr. Colman acquaints his readers, in his Preface to this play, dated
1808, that it was written near twenty years ago: then, stating, as an
apology to his jocose accusers, this reason for having made Shakespeare
the model for his dialogue&mdash;that plays, which exhibit incidents of
former ages, should have the language of the characters conform to
their dress&mdash;he adds&mdash;"To copy Shakspeare, in the general <i>tournure</i> of
his phraseology, is a mechanical task, which may be accomplished with
a common share of industry and observation:&mdash;and this I have attempted
(for the reason assigned); endeavouring, at the same time, to avoid a
servile quaintness, which would disgust. To aspire to a resemblance of
his boundless powers, would have been the labour of a coxcomb;&mdash;and had
I been vain enough to have essayed it, I should have placed myself in a
situation similar to that of the strolling actor, who advertised his
performance of a part"&mdash;"In imitation of the inimitable Garrick."
</p>
<p>
"The Battle of Hexham" has been one of the author's most popular works;
and has, perhaps, to charge its present loss of influence with the
public, to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>[4]</span>

           those historical events of modern times, which have steeled
the heart against all minor scenes of woe, and deprived of their
wonted interest the sorrows of Queen Margaret and her child.
</p>
<p>
There is a short, but well known narrative, written by one Clery,
an humble valet de chambre&mdash;which, for pathetic claims, in behalf of
suffering majesty and infant royalty, may bid defiance to all that
history has before recorded, or poets feigned, to melt the soul to
sympathy.
</p>
<p>
Nor can anxiety be now awakened in consequence of a past battle at
Hexham, between a few thousand men, merely disputing which of two
cousins should be their king, when, at this present period, hundreds
of thousands yearly combat and die, in a cause of far less doubtful
importance.
</p>
<p>
The loyal speeches of Gondibert, in this play, his zeal in the cause of
his sovereign, every reader will admire&mdash;yet one difficulty occurs to
abate this admiration&mdash;Did Gondibert know who his sovereign <i>was</i>? This
question seems to be involved in that same degree of darkness, in which
half the destructive battles which ever took place have been fought.
</p>
<p>
The adverse parties at Hexham had each a sovereign. Edward the Fourth
was the lawful king of the York adherents, as Henry the Sixth was of
those of Lancaster; and Edward had at least birthright on his side,
being the lineal descendant of the elder brother of Henry the Fourth,
and, as such, next heir to Richard the Second, setting aside the
usurper.&mdash;But, possibly, the degraded state of Henry the Sixth was

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>[5]</span>

the strongest tie, which bound this valiant soldier to his supposed
allegiance;&mdash;for there are politicians so compassionate towards the
afflicted, or so envious of the prosperous, they will not cordially
acknowledge a monarch until he is dethroned.&mdash;Even the people of
England never would allow the Bourbon family to be the lawful kings
of France, till within these last fifteen years<a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small> 1</small></a>.
</p>
<p>
The youthful reader will delight in the conjugal ardour of Adeline;
whilst the prudent matron will conceive&mdash;that, had she loved her
blooming offspring, as she professes, it had been better to have
remained at home for their protection, than to have wandered in camps
and forests, dressed in vile disguise, solely for the joy of seeing
their father.&mdash;But prudence is a virtue, which would destroy the best
heroine that ever was invented. A mediocrity of discretion even,
dispersed among certain characters of a drama, might cast a gloom over
the whole fable, divest every incident of its power to surprise, take
all point from the catastrophe, and, finally, draw upon the entire
composition, the just sentence of condemnation.

It was since the French Revolution that the crown of
England relinquished its title and claim to the kingdom of France.

SCENE I.
</h3>
<p class="scene">
    <i>An open Country, near Hexham, in Northumberland; with a distant
    View of <span class="sc">Henry the Sixth's</span> Camp. Time Day-break.</i>
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Adeline</span>, in Man's Habit and Accoutrements.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Heigho! Six dark and weary miles, and not yet at the camp.
How tediously affliction paces!&mdash;Come, Gregory! come on. Why, how you
lag behind!&mdash;Poor simple soul! what cares has he to weigh him down? Oh,
yes,&mdash;he has served me from my cradle; and his plain honest heart feels
for his mistress's fallen fortunes, and is heavy.&mdash;Come, my good
fellow, come!
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Gregory</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Mercy on us, how my poor legs do ache!
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> What, with only six miles this morning?&mdash;Fie!
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Six!&mdash;sixteen, if we've gone an inch; my feet are cut
to pieces. A man may as well do penance, with pease in his shoes,
as trudge over these confounded roads in Northumberland. I used to
wonder, when we were at home, in the south, where it is as smooth as
a bowling-green, what the labourers did with all the loose stones they
carried off the highways; but now, I find, they come and shoot their
rubbish in the northern counties. I wish we had never come into them,
with all my heart!
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Then, you are weary of my service&mdash;you wish you had not
followed me.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Who I? Heaven forbid!&mdash;I'd follow you to the end of the
world:&mdash;nay, for that matter, I believe I shall follow you there; for
I have tramped after you a deuced long way, without knowing where we
are going. But I'd live, ay, and die for you too.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Well, well; we must to the wars, my good fellow.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> The wars! O lud! that's taking me at my word with a
vengeance! I never could abide fighting&mdash;there's something so plaguy
quarrelsome in it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Then you had best return. We now, Gregory, are approaching
King Henry's camp.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Are we? Oh dear, oh dear! Pray, then, let us wheel about as
fast as we can.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Don't you observe the light breaking through the tents
yonder?
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Mercy on me! they are tents, sure enough! Come, madam, let's
be going, if you please.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Why, whither should I go, poor simpleton? My home is
wretchedness. The wars I seek have made it so; they have robbed me of
my husband; comfort now is lost to me. Oh! Gondibert, too faithful to
a weak cause, our ruin is involved with our betters!
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Oh, rot the cause, say I! Plague on the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>[9]</span>

                                                   House of Lancaster!
it has been many a noble gentleman's undoing. The white and red roses
have caused more eyes to water in England, than if we had planted
the whole island with onions. Such a coil kept up with their two
houses!&mdash;one's so old and t'other's so old!&mdash;they ought both to be
pulled down, for a couple of nuisances to the nation.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Peace! peace, man!&mdash;half such a word, spoken at random,
might cost your life. The times, Gregory, are dangerous.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Very true, indeed, madam. Death has no modesty in him
now-a-days; he stares every body full in the face. I wish we had kept
quiet at home, out of his way. Who knows but my master, Lord Gondibert,
might have returned to us, unexpectedly; I'm sure he left us
unexpectedly enough; for the deuce a bit of any notice did he give us
of his going.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Ay, Gregory; was it not unkind? And yet I will not call him
so&mdash;the times are cruel&mdash;not my husband.&mdash;His affection had too much
thought in it to change. His regular love, corrected by the steady
vigour of his mind, knew not the turbulence of boyish raptures; but,
like a sober river in its banks, flowed with a sweet and equal current.
Oh! it was such a placid stream of tenderness!&mdash;How long is it since
your master left us, Gregory?
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Six months come to-morrow, madam. I caught a violent cold
the very same day: it has settled in my eyes, I believe, for they have
been troublesome to me ever since. Ah! I shall never forget that morning;
when the spies of the House of York, that's got upon the throne,
surrounded him for being an old friend to the Lancasters. Egad, he laid
about him like a lion!&mdash;Out whips his broad-sword; whack he comes me
one over the sconce; pat he goes me another on the cheek; and, after
putting them all out of breath, about he wheels his horse, and we have
never seen nor heard of him since.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> And, from that day to this, I have in vain cherished hopes
of his return.&mdash;Fearful, no doubt, of being surprised, he keeps
concealed.&mdash;Thus is he torn from me&mdash;torn from his children&mdash;poor
tender blossoms! too weak to be exposed to the rude tempest of the
times, and leaves their innocence unsheltered!
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Yes, and mine among the rest. But what is it you mean to
do, madam?
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> To seek him in the camp. The Lancasters again are making
head, here, in the north. If he have had an opportunity of joining
them, 'tis more than probable he is in their army. Thither will
we;&mdash;and for this purpose have I doff'd my woman's habit; leaving my
house to the care of a trusty friend: and, thus accoutred, have led
you, Gregory, the faithful follower of my sorrows, a weary journey half
over England.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Weary! oh dear, no&mdash;not at all&mdash;I could turn about again
directly, and walk back, brisker by half than I came.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> What, man, afraid! Come, come; we run but little risk.
Example, too, will animate us. The very air of the camp, Gregory, will
brace your courage to the true pitch.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> That may be, madam; and yet, for a bracing air, people are
apt to die in it, sooner than in any other place.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Pshaw! pr'ythee, man, put but a confident look on the
matter, and we shall do, I warrant. A bluff and blustering outside
often conceals a chicken heart. Mine aches, I am sure! but I will hide
my grief under the veil of airy carelessness.&mdash;Down, sorrow! I'll be
all bustle, like the occasion. Come, Gregory! Mark your mistress, man,
and learn: see how she'll play the pert young soldier.

I wonder, though, how your bold fellows find themselves just before
they're going to fight. I wonder if they have any uncomfortable sort
of sticking in the throat, and a queer kind of a cold tickling feel in
some part of the flesh. Ah! Gregory, Gregory Gubbins! your peaceable
qualities will never do for a camp. I never could bear gunpowder, since
I got fuddled at the fair, and the boys tied crackers, under Dobbin's
tail, in the Market Place.

SCENE II.
</h3>

<p class="scene">
<span class="sc">Henry the Sixth's</span> <i>Camp, at Hexham.</i>
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter a <span class="sc">Drummer</span> and a <span class="sc">Fifer</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Drum.</i> Morrow to you, Master Tooting&mdash;a merry day-breaking to your
worship.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fifer.</i> A sad head-breaking, I fancy. Plaguy troublesome times,
brother! Buffetted, by the opposite party, out of one place, and now
waiting till they come to buffet us out of another. Whenever they do
come, let me tell you, a man will scarce have time to get up from his
straw bed, before he's laid down again by a long shot of the enemy. We
shall be popp'd at like a parcel of partridges, rising from stubble.
</p>
<p>
<i>Drum.</i> Pshaw! plague, what signifies taking matters to heart? Luck's
all. War's a chance, you know. If one day's bad, another's better.
What matters an odd drubbing, or so? A soldier should never grumble.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fifer.</i> Why, zouns! flesh and blood, nor any thing that belongs to a
camp, can't help it. Do, now, only give your drum a good beating, and
mind what a damn'd noise it will make.&mdash;Not grumble, when we take so
many hard knocks?
</p>
<p>
<i>Drum.</i> No, to be sure; else how should we be able to return them?
</p>
<p>
<i>Fifer.</i> Ay, there stands the case; we never can return them. Others
can have a blow, and give a blow; but as for me, and yourself, and Kit
Crackcheeks, the trumpeter; 'sbud, they may thump us

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name="page14"></a>[14]</span>

                                                     from morning to
night, and all the revenge we have, is&mdash;Toot-a-too, rub-a-dub, and
tantararara.
</p>
<p>
<i>Drum.</i> O fie! learn to know our consequence better, brother, I beseech
you. My word for it, we are the heros that do all the execution. Who
but we keep up the vigour of an engagement, and the courage of the
soldiers? Fear, brother, is, for all the world, like your bite of a
tarantula; there's no conquering its effects without music. We are of
as much consequence to an army, as wind to a windmill: the wings can't
be put in motion without us.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fifer.</i> Marry, that's true: and if two armies ever meet without coming
to blows, nothing but our absence can be the occasion of it. The only
way to restore harmony is, to take away our music.
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter a <span class="sc">Corporal</span> and <span class="sc">Soldiers</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Soldier.</i> Come along, my boys; now for the news!
</p>
<p>
<i>Corp.</i> Silence!
</p>
<p>
<i>Soldiers.</i> Ay, ay&mdash;Silence.
</p>
<p>
<i>Corp.</i> Hold your peace, there, and listen to what I'm going to inform
you&mdash;Hem!&mdash;Who am I?
</p>
<p>
<i>All Soldiers.</i> Our corporal! Alick Puff;&mdash;our corporal.
</p>
<p>
<i>Corp.</i> O ho! am I so?&mdash;then obey orders, you riotous rascals, and keep
your tongues between the few teeth the civil war has been civil enough
to leave you. What! is it for a parcel of pitiful privates to gabble
before their superior officer! know yourselves for a set of ignorant
boobies, as you are&mdash;and do not forget that I am at the head of you.
</p>
<p>
<i>Drum.</i> But, pr'ythee, good Master Corporal, what news?
</p>
<p>
<i>Corp.</i> Ay, there it is; good Master Corporal, and sweet Master Corporal,
the news? who is to tell you, but I? and what do I ever get by it?
</p>
<p>
<i>Fifer.</i> Come, come, you shall have our thanks with all our hearts;&mdash;we
promise you that.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Soldier.</i> Ay, ay, that you shall&mdash;now for it!
</p>
<p>
<i>Corp.</i> Then!&mdash;You remember your promise?
</p>
<p>
<i>All Soldiers.</i> Yes, yes, we do.
</p>
<p>
<i>Corp.</i> Why, then, you'll all have your throats cut before to-morrow
morning.
</p>
<p>
<i>All.</i> How!
</p>
<p>
<i>Drum.</i> Pshaw! it can't be!
</p>
<p>
<i>Corp.</i> See there, now! just as I expected.&mdash;After all I have imparted,
merely for your pleasure and satisfaction, not a man among you has the
gratitude to say, thank you, Corporal, for your kind information.
</p>
<p>
<i>Drum.</i> But, is the enemy at hand?
</p>
<p>
<i>Corp.</i> No matter, Mum! only when the business is over with you, and
you are all stiff in the field, do me the credit to say, afterwards, I
was the first that told you it would happen. I, Alexander Puff, corporal
to King Henry the Sixth, (Heaven bless him!) in his majesty's camp, at
Hexham, in Northumberland.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fifer.</i> Well, though they do muster strong, we may make Edward's party
skip for all that; if we have but justice on our side.
</p>
<p>
<i>Corp.</i> Well said, Master Wiseacre!&mdash;Justice! No, no! Might overcomes
right, now a days. Bully Rebellion has almost frightened Justice out of
her wits; and, when she ventures to weigh causes, her hand trembles so
confoundedly, that half the merits tumble out of the scale.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fifer.</i> But, still, I say&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Corp.</i> Say no more&mdash;but take care of yourself in the battle&mdash;that's
all.&mdash;'Sblood! if the enemy were to find your little, dry, taper
carcase, pink'd full of round holes, they'd mistake you for your own
fife. But, remember this, my lads. Edward of York has again shoved King
Henry from his possessions, and squatted his own usurping, beggarly
gallygaskins, in the clean seat of sovereignty; and here are we brave
fellows, at Hexham, come to place him on the stool

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>[16]</span>

                                                   of repentance. And
there's our king at the head of us&mdash;and there's his noble consort, the
sword and buckler, Queen Margaret&mdash;and there's the Lord Seneschal of
Normandy&mdash;and the Lord Duke of Somerset&mdash;and the Lord knows who!&mdash;The
enemy is at hand, with a thumping power; so up, courage, and to
loggerheads we go for it.&mdash;Huzza! for the Red Roses, and the House
of Lancaster.
</p>
<p>
<i>All.</i> Huzza! huzza! huzza!

<i>Outside of the Royal Tent.</i>
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Fool</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Fool.</i> Queen Margaret has sheltered me from the peltings of fortune,
this many a year. Now the pelting has damaged my shelter; but still I
stick to it. More simpleton I!&mdash;to stand, like a thin-clad booby, in
a hard shower, under an unroofed penthouse. Truly, for a fool of my
experience, I have but little wisdom: and yet a camp suits well with
my humour; take away the fighting&mdash;the sleeping in a field&mdash;the bad
fare&mdash;the long marches, and the short pay&mdash;and a soldier's is a rare
merry life.&mdash;Here come two more musterers&mdash;troth we have need of
them&mdash;for, considering the goodness of the cause, they drop in as
sparingly as mites into a poor's box.
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Adeline</span> and <span class="sc">Gregory</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Tremble not now, Gregory, for your life!
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Lord, madam, that is the only thing I do tremble for: if I
had as many lives as a cat, I must borrow a tenth, I fancy, to carry me
out of this place.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Pooh! pr'ythee&mdash;we are here among friends. Did you not mark
the courtesy of the centinels; who, upon signifying our intentions, bid
us pass on, till we should find a leader, to whom we might tender our
services?
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Ah! and there he is, I suppose. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Pointing to the <span class="sc">Fool</span>.</i>]</span>

                                     fellow&mdash;his coat has been so pepper'd
with musket shot in the wars, that 'tis patch'd from the very top to the
bottom.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Tut, tut, man! your fears have made you blind; this motley
gentleman's occupation has nothing terrible in it, I'll answer for
it&mdash;we will accost him. How now, fellow?
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> How now, fool?
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> What, sirrah? call you me fool?
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> 'Faith may I, sir; when you call me fellow. Hail to you, sir,
you are very well met. Nay you need not be ashamed of me for a companion;
simple though I seem, we fools come of a great family, with a number of
rich relations.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Why do you follow the camp, fool?
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> For the same reason that a blind beggar follows his dog;&mdash;though
it may lead me where my neck may be broke, I can't get on in the world
without it. You, sir, I take it, are come, like me, to shoot your bolt
at the enemy?
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> I come, partly, indeed, among other purposes, to offer my
weak aid to the army.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> Your weakness, sir, acts marvellously wisely: you'll be the
clean-shaved Nestor of the regiment.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> If I could find your leader, I would vouch, too, for the
integrity of this my follower, to be received into the ranks.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Oh no, you need not put yourself to the trouble of vouching
for me.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> Right; for your knave, when great folks have occasion for him,
is received with little inquiry into his character. Marry, let an
honest man lack their assistance, and starving stares him in the face,
for want of a recommendation.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Lead us to your General, and you shall be well remember'd by
me.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> Why, as to a General, I can stand you in little stead; but if
such a simple thing as a Queen

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page19" name="page19"></a>[19]</span>

                               can content you, I am your only man: for
 being a proper fellow, and a huge tickler up of a lady's fancy, I may
chance to push your fortune as far as another. Truly, you fell into
good hands when you stumbled on me. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Flourish.</i>]</span> Stand back, here

<i>1 Rob.</i> Sung like true and noble boys of plunder! Isn't this
free-booting spirit, now, better than leading a cowardly life of musty
regularity? Honesty is a scarce and tender commodity, that perishes
almost as soon as it appears:&mdash;the rich man is not known to have it,
for fortune has never put him to the test; and the poor blockhead, that
boasts on't, dies for hunger in proving it.
</p>
<p>
<i>2 Rob.</i> Right; it is but a fever in the blood, that soon kills the
patient if it be not expelled.&mdash;I had the fever, once.
</p>
<p>
<i>4 Rob.</i> And what was your cure for't?
</p>
<p>
<i>2 Rob.</i> Starving. Ever while you live, starve your fever:&mdash;when
honesty is your case, only call in poverty as physician, and the
disease soon yields to his prescriptions.

lady, on a pad nag, eleven pounds, four groats, and a portmanteau.&mdash;She
seemed marvellously frightened, and whispered thanks, privately, for
her delivery.</i>

<p>

delivered, and whispered thanks for it in private.

<p>
2 Rob. <i>From a Scotch laird, on his way from London to Inverness&mdash;by
Philip Thunder in gloves; the whole provision for his journey, viz. one
cracked angel, and two sticks of brimstone.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>1 Rob.</i> Who has his horse?
</p>
<p>
<i>2 Rob.</i> No one; the Scotch laird travelled on foot. <i>From a pair of
justices of the peace, a foundered mare, a black gelding, two doublets,
and a hundred marks in gold&mdash;they were tied back to back;&mdash;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>1 Rob.</i> Good! It is but right, that they who bind over so many, should
at last, be bound over themselves; and a wise thief is ever bound in
justice to put a foolish justice in binding.
</p>
<p>
2 Rob. <i>Back to back, and hoodwinked&mdash;They were left, lamenting their
fate, in the forest.</i>
</p>

not know that Justice should

                             always be blind. Marry, a good day! Are there
any more?
</p>
<p>
<i>2 Rob.</i> Only a fat friar, who was half plundered, and saved himself
by flight.
</p>
<p>
<i>1 Rob.</i> The better fortune his. Few fat friars, I fancy, have the luck
to be saved. What did he yield?
</p>
<p>
2 Rob. <i>The rope from his middle, a bottle of sack from his bosom, and
a link of hog's puddings, pulled out of his left sleeve.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>1 Rob.</i> Gad a mercy, friar! For the sack, and the sausages, they shall
be shared, merrily, among us; and for the rope,&mdash;hum!&mdash;come, we won't
think of that, now. <span class="dir-i">[<i>A Horn wound lowly.</i>]</span> Hark! there's our Captain's
horn!&mdash;'faith, for one who, I suspect is married, he chuses an odd
signal of approach.
</p>
<p>
<i>2 Rob.</i> Nay, though he may be married, he's no milksop; and, I warrant
him, when he's on duty, and robbing among us, he quite forgets his
wife, as an honest man should do. He has joined us but a short time,
yet, egad, he heads us nobly! He'll pluck you an hundred crowns from a
rich fellow's pocket, with one hand, and throw his share of them into a
hungry beggar's hat, with the other. But, here he comes.

</p>

<p>
<i>All.</i> Hail, noble Captain!
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> How now, my bold and rugged companions! What has been done in
my absence?
</p>
<p>
<i>1 Rob.</i> Oh, sir, a deal of business&mdash;We have been washing down old
scores, and getting vigour for new. We have had a cup for every breach
of the law we have committed. Marry, sir, ours is a rare cellar, to
stand such a soaking.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> Now then, to a business of greater import. I have been lurking
round the camp, here, on the skirts of the forest. The parties have
met, and a hot battle ensued. It was a long time fought with such
stubborn courage, that, as I stood observing it, the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page31" name="page31"></a>[31]</span>

                                                      spirit of war,
pent up within me, had well nigh burst my breast.&mdash;Twenty times, I was
at the point of breaking from my shelter, and joining combat. But I am
pledged to you, my fellows;&mdash;that thought restrained me.
</p>
<p>
<i>2 Rob.</i> O, noble Captain!&mdash;but who has conquered?
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> Ay, there it is:&mdash;'sdeath and fury, my blood boiled to see it!
The sleek, upstart rascals, cut through the ranks as if&mdash;oh! a plague
on their well feeding!&mdash;We had carried it else, all the world to
nothing!
</p>
<p>
<i>2 Rob.</i> We! why what is it to us who has the day? Do but tell us who.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> I had forgot. The Lancasters are defeated, their soldiers
routed, and many of their leaders dispersed about the country. Some,
no doubt, are in the forest. Usurping war never glutted on a richer
banquet.
</p>
<p>
<i>1 Rob.</i> Why, it seems to have been a pretty feast; and, the best on't
is, now 'tis over, we shall come in for the picking of the bones.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> It may be so. You all, I know, will expect a rich booty; and
they whom we shall meet will, probably, from the unsettled nature of
the times, bear their whole wealth about their persons:&mdash;but they are
brave, and have been oppressed;&mdash;disappointment, therefore, and their
situation, may cause them to fight in their defence, like heros.
</p>
<p>
<i>2 Rob.</i> Nay, an they fight like devils, they'll find we can match them
in courage. Put me to any proof you please, and they shall soon find me
a man.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> Then, prove it, friend, by pity for the unfortunate. Believe
me, comrades, he has little better to boast than a brute, who cannot
temper his courage with feeling. And, now, as our expedition is at
hand, let each of you observe my orders. If there be any whose
appearance denotes a more than common birth, treat

this, thou poor, base reptile! how to show mercy to others whom fortune
places in thy power. Now, friends, all to your posts. I shall go forth
alone. You have your orders, and I know you will obey them strictly.
The night steals on us apace; and the angry clouds, threatning a storm,
add to the awful gloom of the forest. Away, boys! and be steady.

your ears, and lose your tongues. Listen, in silence, for the tread of
a passenger; and, when he's near enough, spring upon him, like so many
cats at a mouse hole.

SCENE II.
</h3>

<p class="scene">
<i>Part of the Forest.</i>
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Adeline</span> and <span class="sc">Gregory</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Gently, good madam; gently, for the love of corns! Where is
it you mean to go?
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Even where chance shall carry us, Gregory.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> 'Faith, madam, and if chance would carry us, it would be
doing us a great favour; for we have walked far enough, in all
conscience.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Then, here, my good fellow, we must rest ourselves.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Here! what in the wood? and night coming on!
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Good faith even here!&mdash;here, for necessity demands it, we
must pass the night: and, in the morning, the ring-dove, cooing to its
mate, will wake us to our journey homeward. This is a retreat, were but
the mind at ease, a king might well repose in.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> It must be King Nebuchadnezzar then: if we haven't some of
his grass-eating qualities, we shall find ourselves badly off for a
supper. 'Tis ten to one, too, but we may wander here for a week,
without finding our way out again.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Oh! this world! this world! I am weary on't! 'Would I had
been some villager!&mdash;'twere well, now, to be a shepherd's boy&mdash;he has
no cares&mdash;but while his sheep browse on the mountain's side, with
vacant mind&mdash;happy in ignorance&mdash;he sinks to sleep, o'ercanopied with
heaven, and makes the turf his pillow.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Yes, but he has plaguy damp sheets, for all that. I'd
exchange all the turf and sky in the county, for a good warm barn and a
blanket; and as for the cooing doves, I would not give a crack'd tester
for a forest full of them; unless I could see some of their claws stuck
up through the holes of a brown piecrust.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Fie! Gregory; be content, be content. Think that we are
happy in this forest, in having thus escaped the enemy's fire, and be
grateful in the change.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Why, we are out of the fire, to be sure; but, make the best
on't we can, we are still in the frying-pan. And starving is one of
those blessings for which people are not very apt to be thankful. But
we have escaped killing; so I'll e'en be content, as long as there is
comfort in comparison. I stumbled over a fat trumpeter in the field,
stript and plunder'd, with his skin full of bullets. Well, I am
thankful yet&mdash;mine is a marvellous happy lot, to be better than a dead
trumpeter!
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Truce now, Gregory; and consider how we can best dispose
ourselves here, till the morning.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Nay, there's no need of much consideration; there's little
distinction of apartments here, madam: we shall both sleep on the
ground floor&mdash;and our lodgings will be pure and airy, I warrant them.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Peace, fool! nor let thy grosser mind, half fears, half
levity, thus trifle with my feelings! I have borne me up against
affliction, till my o'ercharged bosom can contain no longer.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> O the father! look if my poor dear lady be not a
weeping!&mdash;why, madam&mdash;Lady Adeline&mdash;dear madam! I am but a fool as you
say; but I'm as honest and as faithful as the greatest knave of them
all:&mdash;and haven't I sighed, sobbed, fasted, fought, and run away, to
show you that I would stand by you to the last? and haven't I&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Pr'ythee, no more, Gregory! bear with, my pettishness&mdash;for,
now and then, the tongue of disappointment will needs let fall some of
the acid drops which misery sprinkles the heart withal.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Now must I play the comforter. Why, lord, madam, I think,
when a body comes to be used to it a little, this forest must be a
sweet, dingy, retired, gloomy, pleasant sort of a place;&mdash;besides,
what's one night? sleeping bears it out&mdash;and I'll warrant us we'll find
such snug delicious beds of dry leaves, that&mdash; <span class="dir-i">[<i>Hard shower</i>.]</span> 'Sbud!
no!&mdash;I lie&mdash;it rains like all the dogs and cats in the kingdom&mdash;there
won't be a dry twig left, large enough to shelter a cock-chafer&mdash;we
shall both be sopped here, like two toasts in a tankard&mdash; <span class="dir-i">[<i>Thunder.</i></span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Why, why should fortune sport with a weak woman thus! why,
fickle goddess, wanton as boys in giddy cruelty, torture a silly fly
before you kill it?
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> 'Faith, madam, for that matter, I am but a blue-bottle of
fortune's myself; and, though sorrow is dry, they say, this is a sort
of soaking it does not care to be moistened with. If it would rain good
barrels of ale, now, sorrow would not so much mind being out in the
storm. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Thunder again.</i>]</span> No; sorrow would be disappointed there too:
this rumbling is enough to flatten the finest beer shower, a man would
wish to take a whet in.&mdash;Lud! lud! madam! let's get out ou't, if
there's a hollow tree to be found. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Thunder.</i></span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> The thunder rolls awful on the ear, and strikes the soul
with terror. The plunderer, too, perhaps catching the sulphurous flash,
explores his wretched prey, and stalks to midnight murder.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Mercy on us, madam, don't talk of that!&mdash;now I think on't,
if we were to pick and chuse, for a twelvemonth, we couldn't have
pitched upon a more convenient place to be knocked down in. Shelter!
dear madam! shelter.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name="page37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Is it thus you stand by me, Gregory? I, at least, hoped you
had valour enough to&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dir-r">
[<i><span class="sc">Robbers</span> appear behind, and slowly advance.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> Exactly enough; but not a morsel to spare. So we'll e'en
look out for a place of safety. Not that I'm afraid though.&mdash;Stand by
you?&mdash;egad, if half a dozen, now, of stout, raw-boned fellows were to
dare to molest you, I would make no more of whipping this <span class="dir-i">[<i>Drawing his

would you have?
</p>
<p>
<i>1 Rob.</i> What you have.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> If it is our lives you seek, they are so care worn, that in
resigning them, we part with that which is scarce worth the keeping.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory.</i> 'Tis very true indeed. Pray don't take them,
gentlemen;&mdash;they'll do you no kind of good.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>1 Rob.</i> Marry, a well favoured boy. Say, youth, whence came you, and
whither bound?
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> I scarce know whither; but I came far inland; sent by my
father to the wars; his sword the sole inheritance his age can leave
me. This man, a faithful servant of our cottage, in simple love has
followed me.
</p>
<p>
<i>1 Rob.</i> Well, youth; be of good cheer&mdash;He, who has little, has little
to lose; and a soldier's pocket is seldom much lighter for emptying.
Come; you must both with us&mdash;bring them to our captain's cave.

SCENE I.
</h3>

<p class="scene">
<i>A Village, on the Skirts of the Forest.</i>
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Fool</span> and a <span class="sc">Villager</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Vil.</i> Tell me, good fellow, now, I pr'ythee&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> But wilt thou lend an ear to my tale?
</p>
<p>
<i>Vil.</i> That will I; all the ears I am worth.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> Then need not I tell the story:&mdash;for, if thou lend'st all thy
ears, then thou'lt have none left to hear it.&mdash;Wast ever in a battle,
old boy?
</p>
<p>
<i>Vil.</i> No, truly!
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> Then thou art a dead man.
</p>
<p>
<i>Vil.</i> What, for not being in a battle!
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> Yea, marry,&mdash;by the very first rapier that comes in thy
way;&mdash;for no man can live by the sword but a soldier;&mdash;and of soldiers
there are three degrees; and three only.
</p>
<p>
<i>Vil.</i> As how?
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> As thus:&mdash;Your hot fighter&mdash;your cool fighter&mdash;and your
fighter-shy.&mdash;The last degree makes a wondrous figure, in many
muster-rolls.
</p>
<p>
<i>Vil.</i> Of which last you make one.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> In some degree.
</p>
<p>
<i>Vil.</i> And it was that made you run from the battle.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> Right; running is your only surety. Bully Achilles, the great
warrior of old, thought otherwise;

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page44" name="page44"></a>[44]</span>

                                   and he was vulnerable only in the
heel:&mdash;now, my heels always insure me from being wounded.&mdash;Dost know
why Heaven makes one leg of a man stouter than the other?
</p>
<p>
<i>Vil.</i> No.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> That he may be able to put the best leg foremost, when there's
occasion.
</p>
<p>
<i>Vil.</i> And you had occasion enough, last night.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> Truly, had I; and thus came I to your cottage; where I slept on
a bare board all night.
</p>
<p>
<i>Vil.</i> Ah! Heaven knows my lodging is poor enough! but such as it is,
you are welcome.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> Nay, I quarrel not with the lodging; I only complain of the
board&mdash;and now wouldst thou know my story.
</p>
<p>
<i>Vil.</i> I would willingly hear of the battle that was lost.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> Then pr'ythee, ask of those that found it: but, come, I'll e'en
tell thee how it was.&mdash;&mdash;Thou hast a wife?
</p>
<p>
<i>Vil.</i> Yes, forsooth;&mdash;that was my old dame you saw at home.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> Keep her there; for nature plainly intended her for a homely
woman&mdash;Didst ever quarrel with her before marriage?
</p>
<p>
<i>Vil.</i> Never.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> Afterwards, a little?
</p>
<p>
<i>Vil.</i> Um!&mdash;Why, to say the truth, my poor dame has a fine flourish
with a cudgel; but people will needs fall out, now and then, when once
they come together.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> That's the very way we lost the battle:&mdash;for had the two
parties never met, depend on't, one had never cudgel'd the other.
</p>
<p>
<i>Vil.</i> Mass! thou art a rare fellow in the field!
</p>
<p>
<i>Fool.</i> Very rare;&mdash;for I never come there but when I can't help it.

among these clowns;&mdash;and why not? Soldiers are but cutters down of

</p>

<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> Away all night! What then? Am not I their leader? Do they
begin to doubt me? Am not I, as it were, wedded to the party?
</p>
<p>
<i>Rob.</i> Very true, noble captain: and we have treated you as a wife
would a kind husband:&mdash;but when a husband is out all night&mdash;why&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> Well, sir;&mdash;what then?
</p>
<p>
<i>Rob.</i> Marry, then, the wife is apt to grumble a little; that's all.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> Go to;&mdash;I had reason. What's the news?
</p>
<p>
<i>Rob.</i> The news is, we have taken some stragglers, in the forest.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> Are they of note?
</p>
<p>
<i>Rob.</i> 'Faith, we have some of all qualities;&mdash;gentle and simple
mixed:&mdash;we had no time to stand upon the picking:&mdash;they're all penn'd
up in the back cavern;&mdash;and you must e'en take 'em like a score of
sheep&mdash;fat and lean together. But, there is a beardless youth, follow'd
by a cowardly serving man, who presses hard to see you.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> What would he?
</p>
<p>
<i>Rob.</i> 'Faith, sir, he would be a noble fellow. I take it he has a
great soul, too large for the laws;&mdash;he has questioned me plentifully
concerning you.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> Concerning me?
</p>
<p>
<i>Rob.</i> Yes; he inquired if you were married; how long you had been with
us; your age; your stature;

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name="page52"></a>[52]</span>

                            nay, he was particular enough to ask what
sort of a nose stood on your face.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> Wherefore these questions?
</p>
<p>
<i>Rob.</i> Troth, I think he would like well to serve in our band; for
he seems to have a marvellous nice notion of honour. He took up your
dagger, of curious workmanship, that lies on your table, in the cave,
and did so study the dudgeon on't!&mdash;Marry, the boy knows how to handle
a weapon, I'll warrant him.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> Where have you bestowed him?
</p>
<p>
<i>Rob.</i> Why, he was so importunate, that I have brought him, and his
man, hither along.&mdash;The man, I feared, might babble: so, I've entrusted
him to your friend Barton, here; and he, finding he has been a butler,
has locked him in the cellarage.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> Conduct the youth hither.

<i>Gondi.</i> Now to your business, youth.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> 'Tis brief.&mdash;I have been sorely wrung, sir, by the keen
pressure of mishap.&mdash;I once had friends: they have left me. One whom
I thought a special one&mdash;a noble gentleman&mdash;who pledged himself, by
all the ties that are most binding to a man, to guard my uninstructed
youth&mdash;even he, to whom my soul looked up; whom, I might say, I loved
as with a woman's tenderness,&mdash;even he has, now, deserted me.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> Then he acted basely.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> I hope not so, sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Gondi.</i> Trust me, I think he did, youth; for there is an open native
sincerity that marks thy countenance, which I scarce believe could give
just cause to a steady friend to leave thee.
</p>
<p>
<i>Adeline.</i> Now, by my holy dame, he had none to suspect me. Yet, from
the pressure of the time,&mdash;some trying chance&mdash;but, I am wandering.
This is my suit to you.&mdash;If you should find me fit to be entrusted with
the secrets of your party, I could wish to be enrolled among you.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
